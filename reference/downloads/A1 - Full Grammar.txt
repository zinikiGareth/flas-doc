title=Full Grammar
style=appendix


This is the complete grammar for the core FLAS language.  Each of the productions should have been extracted and discussed somewhere in the main text of this manual.


The syntax used here is essentially Backus-Naur Form (BNF), but with additions for FLAS indenting rules:


$*>>*$ indicates an indented block which may have zero or more repetitions of the rule.


$*>>!*$ indicates an indented block which must have exactly one repetition of the rule.


$*>>?*$ indicates an optional indented block; if present, it will have exactly one repetition of the rule.


$*>>>*$ indicates an indented block with one or more repetitions of the rule.
