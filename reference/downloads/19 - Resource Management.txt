I'm not going to say anything here just yet, although this is a very important topic.


Most of the stuff is fairly standard garbage collection


But we need to talk about


* punnets, cards, handles and the like
* handlers and creation and destruction
* subscriptions and when they go away (closely tied to handlers of course)
* and possibly something about idempotent handlers for "PUT" operations, although that is on the border with server-side semantics again.
