I want to have a lot of the words I want to say captured and presented as speaker notes
I definitely need to have "alternative paths" listed
But the presentation mainly wants to be pictures that illustrate things
I would like it to be whizzy and animated as much as possible, whatever that means


- Possibly slides flipping
- Possibly things sliding across
- Don't forget we're already paying for 3D
-   except we're not when we're dealing with slide animation - that's 2d in overlay

// for things like this, I want to be able to have "animation steps"
// so have a construct "step" that knows about that
// it can have options such as time & delay & it also has "content"
// it can also have an "effect"
// which basically takes you back to the top level
// These things include: "image" (an image to display) and "speaker" (a speaker message)
// image can include not just the image but also options such as "position", "size", "scale", "rotation"
// these will be its final attributes, after the animation stops, but will inform the animation


// I'm not quite sure why I'm writing this here, but I think this might be a good slide to start on
// A KEY, KEY THING is that it doesn't get too "in the weeds".  You should be able to easily say
// step
//   animate 'toss'
//   img
//      position 75% 35%
//      rotation 45
//   speaker 'message'


// and it should just figure out the rest


I would like this slide to just pile up with pictures of things

* slide the-basic-architecture
** format boring-slide
                split into two parts
                (1) is the client side programming language which connects to the UI and does all that
                        You can use this without thinking about the server
                        although there are server implications around deployment
                (2) is the server side interface which connects clients and servers and integrates the two
                        we'll come back to that (or not if just talking to UI folks)
                        but all with the same programming language
                        just additional features


* slide client-side-architecture
** format boring-slide
                image of a food mixer that integrates HTML, CSS and FLAS
                "Bring your own web design"
                I use webflow to build what amounts to static content
                [img of hello world in webflow]
                The only magic is in the ids.
                [zoom in to show the id field highlighted - flas-content-hello]
The answer is "hello, world" is in the HTML.
        [pan over to that]


* slide handling-events
** format boring-slide
        hello world is all well and good
        but it's not very exciting
        we want at least to be able to handle events
        [toggle example on the screen]


* slide actor-model
** format boring-slide
** speaker 'explain what it means with an image of the basic architecture with an event loop inside and messages between'
** speaker 'this is a new kind of abstraction'
** speaker 'although new is relative - actors have been around since 1967'
** speaker 'but they were diluted into classes and objects'
** speaker 'the key is to have a VM like thing - memory, event loop/processor, input/output'
I want a graphic with the three kinds of actors (cards, agents, services) with their various properties, and message passing
In the center is "ACTOR"
        these are all actors BUT they are not the same
        cards also have UI that means they can interact with the user and receive events
        mainly actors just receive messages
