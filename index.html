<h1>FLAS</h1>
<p>FLAS is a system for the development and deployment of card-based systems using functional programming and actor models.</p>
<p>The FLAS language supports the definition of contracts, cards and services to cover the entire spectrum of application development in a target-neutral way.</p>
<p>Compilation backends and runtimes are provided for a number of environments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Javascript deployment into a browser;
<li>Android packaging to build APKs for mobile phones;
<li>JVM code to install into Java-based servers such as Ziniki;
<li>Javascript modules for deployment into Node.js servers;
<li>PHP?
</ul>
<h2>FLAS Language</h2>
<p>Processing FLAS language files consists of four main phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>blocking;
<li>parsing;
<li>resolving;
<li>generating code.
</ul>
<p>These four phases follow on from each other and each consists of a number of sub-phases.</p> 
</ul>
<h3>Blocking</h3>
<p>The first step in interpreting a FLAS program file is to break it into lines, which are grouped into blocks using a simple indent rule.</p>
<p>Blank lines and any lines with no leading white space are considered "literate comments" and are ignored by the compiler (although there should be a <tt>weave</tt>-like tool for generating documentation based on them).</p>
<p>Top-level statements should all begin with exactly one tab character.</p>
<p>Lines that are too long and want to be continued on the next line should have the continuation line begin with the same number of tabs <b>and</b> one or more space characters.</p>
<p>Nested definitions should have exactly one more leading tab than their parent line.</p>
<h3>Parsing</h3>
<p>The syntax of the language can be expressed using a <a href='grammar.html'>formal grammar</a>.</p>
<h3>Resolving</h3>
<h4>Name Resolution</h4>
<h4>Method Conversion<h4>
<h3>Code Generation</h3>
<h4>HSIE Function Generation</h4>
<h4>JavaScript Generation</h4>
<h4>JVM &amp; Android Generation</h4>
<h2>FLAS Runtime</h2>
<h3>Basic Runtime</h3>
<h3>IFrames, workers, sub-cards and security</h3>
<h3>Object wire format (all cases, and what can and cannot be shipped)</h3>
<h3>Object storage (including editing concerns)</h3>
<h3>Disconnected Mode (and reconciliation)</h3>
<h3>Backend connection</h3>
